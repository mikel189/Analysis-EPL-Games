- This is a dataset of teams in the premier league for six (6) seasons
- One main goal is to combined the data to answer some question about specific teams and certain general stats
- Perhaps do some modelling at the end to predict future premier league matches
- Some of the questions we would like to answer include:
--
- How is Chelsea fc's attacking at home and away from home as per goals scored, touches made, shots and other stats
- How is there defending home and away from home in there title winning season.
- For most chelsea wins, draws, and loses, which referee officiated the match.
- How many clean sheets they held?
- How many times have they come from behind to win a game
- And how these finding conjour with other title winning campagnes for other teams
